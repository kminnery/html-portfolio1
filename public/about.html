  my life.

  Starting at age 12 I started learning guitar and have picked up keyboard
  since. I like to play in churcs as well as other places and enjoy all types of
  music. In my spare time I enjoy working out as well as web development. I
  currently reside on the west side of Cincinnati with my friend Tina and our
  four Boston Terriers.
